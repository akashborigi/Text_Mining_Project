This study delves into the preprocessing and exploratory data analysis of a corpus comprising newspaper articles. The initial phase involves constructing the corpus by loading and segmenting the data into individual articles. Subsequently, the corpus undergoes a refinement process where metadata is separated from the main article content, and pertinent features are extracted. To gain insights and a holistic understanding of the dataset, comprehensive summaries and plots are generated through exploratory data analysis. A key element of the study is the creation of a topic model using the refined corpus. This model is iteratively executed with varying parameters, and the outcomes are documented in output files. The ensuing discussion contextualizes the results within the project's overarching statement, leveraging model outputs and visualizations to reinforce the findings. It is noteworthy that this project does not assume complete domain expertise but rather approaches the analysis with a journalistic perspective. Furthermore, the evaluation of post-processed data quality constitutes an integral part of the assignment's grading criteria.
